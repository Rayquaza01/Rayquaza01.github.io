History Cleaner is 7 years old!

The first version was created on February 8, 2017. I originally created it to be a WebExtension port of [Expire history by days](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/expire-history-by-days/). This was when Firefox was first switching to WebExtensions and removing support for XUL extensions.

Now, 7 years later, it has ~16,000 users on Firefox + ~500 users on Chrome, and is part of Mozilla's Recommended Extensions Program! [Version 1.5.0](https://github.com/Rayquaza01/HistoryCleaner/releases/tag/v1.5.0) came out just a few weeks ago, featuring a UI refresh and a new timer mode to delete history on a set interval.

Thank you to everyone who uses History Cleaner!
